        <h2>Playing</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>You can choose either direction to go when starting on the board. You can go any way you’d like on the board, but you are not allowed to go directly backwards. The board loops back to the beginning so there are no wrong ways to go, just don’t end up with the most coins!
            </li>
            <li>The game will go on until a player reaches 50 coins. The game will end then and the ranking will go from whoever has the least amount of coins to whoever has the most coins.</li>
            <li>When you land on a spot with a chest you can pull a card from the chest, you can save up the cards as long as you like but you may only use one card on a turn.</li>
            <li>You can only keep 5 cards at a time, so either you use those cards or you put them back in the card pile.</li>
        </ul>

            <h1 id="extraTxt">FAQ</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>Which direction does the board start?</li>
                <p>- The board goes both directions, you can choose whichever way to go.</p>
                <li>What are the arrows on the board?</li>
                <p>- If you land on a space with arrows pointing multiple directions it’s giving you the option to either keep going the same direction or head a different direction.</p>
                <li>Can I go on a space occupied by a different player?</li>
                <p>- Yes! You can go over a space that’s occupied by a different player.</p>
                <li>Are all cards usable?</li>
                <p>- Most cards are usable, but there are some cards that will be used on you to give you coins, such as the Birthday Card which gives you five coins or the Gift Bag which gives you ten coins.
